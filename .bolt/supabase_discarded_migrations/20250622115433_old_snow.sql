  # Fix Documents RLS Policies

  1. Security Updates
    - Update INSERT policies for documents table to allow proper document creation
    - Ensure authenticated users can create documents with proper field validation
    - Add policy for service role operations

  2. Policy Changes
    - Modify existing INSERT policies to be more permissive for authenticated operations
    - Add fallback policy for system operations
